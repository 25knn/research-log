## The Project

I am a third-year undergraduate student in **Fundamental Mathematics** at Sorbonne University (Paris).

This "Open Notebook" documents my preparatory work for the **4EU+ BMST** (Bachelor in Mathematics Student Task) program.

I am specifically applying for the project proposed by **Charles University in Prague** regarding the **Brunn-Minkowski Inequality**.

## Philosophy & Goals

My ambition is to pursue research in **Theoretical Artificial Intelligence**. I am convinced that the next breakthroughs in Deep Learning will not come solely from engineering, but from a deep understanding of underlying mathematical structures:

1.  **Asymptotic Geometry:** How do volumes behave as dimension $n \to \infty$?
2.  **Concentration of Measure:** Why does probability mass concentrate on thin structures?
3.  **Probability Theory:** Random walks and Gaussian Chaos.

This blog serves as a public record of my skill acquisition in these fields.
