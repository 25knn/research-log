The **4EU+** university alliance offers a rare opportunity for an undergraduate student: joining a genuine European research project via the BMST program. Among the topics proposed this year (from Warsaw to Copenhagen), one resonated particularly with my ambitions: **the Brunn-Minkowski Inequality**, proposed by Charles University in Prague.

Why this choice?

## Beyond Classical Geometry

The Brunn-Minkowski inequality is fundamental in the geometry of convex bodies. It relates the volume of the Minkowski sum of two compact sets $A$ and $B$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to their respective volumes.

The classical formulation is as follows:

$$
\text{Vol}(A+B)^{1/n} \geq \text{Vol}(A)^{1/n} + \text{Vol}(B)^{1/n}
$$

Where the Minkowski sum is defined by $A+B = \{a+b \mid a \in A, b \in B\}$.

## Why does this matter for AI?

My interest in this theorem goes beyond pure geometric beauty. I aim for a research career at the intersection of mathematics and **Machine Learning**.

The Brunn-Minkowski inequality is the gateway to **concentration of measure theory**. In very high dimensions (which is the case for latent spaces of deep neural networks), classical geometric intuition collapses. Brunn-Minkowski provides the tools to understand how probability concentrates, a key phenomenon to explain the robustness and generalization capabilities of AI models.

## The Battle Plan (Build in Public)

I am not yet an expert in these topics. This blog aims to document my journey.

In the coming weeks, to support my application to Prague and prepare for my Master's in Probability, I will publish here:

1.  My reading notes on convexity.
2.  Python simulations illustrating these geometric phenomena.
3.  Connections between these theorems and recent AI research papers.

The adventure begins now.
